        </P>
           <p> We prioritize strong project management on technology projects. This requires project management staff who understand what the end-user needs, how to effectively triage issues for resolution, and what to raise to government counterparts.</p>
           <p> We also have engagements where we serve in an Enterprise Project Management Office (EPMO) capacity. EPMO is a staff extender model that allows the government to have a vendor manage the project schedule, manage other vendors, and prioritize needs. Read more about how EPMO fits well with agile development practices.
